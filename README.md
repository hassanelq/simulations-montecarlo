# **Financial Simulation Platform**

Welcome to the Financial Simulation Platform, a powerful and interactive tool designed to help you explore quantitative finance concepts. This platform provides simulations for **Normal Distributions**, **Brownian Motion**, and **Monte Carlo Simulations**, offering a deeper understanding of market dynamics and asset behavior.

## **Features**
### **1. Probability Distributions**
- **Normal Distribution:** Simulates and visualizes the bell-shaped curve used to model continuous data.
- **Uniform Distribution:** Demonstrates equal probabilities for all values within a defined range.
- **Exponential Distribution:** Models the time between events in a Poisson process.
- **Poisson Distribution:** Calculates probabilities for the number of events occurring in a fixed interval.
- **Binomial Distribution:** Simulates success/failure outcomes in fixed trials.

### **2. Monte Carlo Simulations**
- **Investment Simulation:** Models the growth of a portfolio over time, considering volatility and contributions.
- **Options Pricing:** Uses Geometric Brownian Motion to estimate the fair value of options.
- **Risk Analysis:** Calculates Value at Risk (VaR) to analyze potential losses in a portfolio.

### **3. Brownian Motion**
- **1D Brownian Motion:** Simulates random motion along a single axis.
- **2D Brownian Motion:** Visualizes random particle motion in two dimensions.
- **Stock Price Simulation:** Models stock price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion.
