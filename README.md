## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ”¢ Probability Distributions
Visualize and analyze continuous, discrete, and rare-event probability distributions including:
- Normal, Uniform, Exponential, Log-Normal, Studentâ€™s t, Beta
- Gamma, Weibull, Triangular
- Poisson, Binomial, Hypergeometric
- Cauchy, LÃ©vy, Pareto

### ðŸ“ˆ Investment Simulation
Simulate portfolio growth over time, incorporating:
- Expected return, volatility, annual contributions
- Monte Carlo method for yearly updates
- Probability of reaching investment goals

### ðŸ’° Options Pricing
Estimate the fair value of European options using:
- Geometric Brownian Motion (Black-Scholes Model)
- Monte Carlo simulation to generate asset price paths
- ITM probability for call and put options
